This script is something i used for saving songs i liked from my winamp playlist. 
I would go through the playlist and when i heard a song i liked i would run the script which would move the cursor to the correct place and go into the filepath info, 
then it would select it by moving the cursor, then it would use that filepath to copy the mp3 file over to a new folder i specified.
